# Smart-Helmet
A smart helmet is a special idea which makes motorcycle driving safer than before. This is implemented using Arduino. The working of this smart helmet using Arduino is very simple, we place vibration sensor in helmet where the probability of hitting is more which are connected to Arduino board. So when the rider crashes and the helmet hits the ground, the sensors sense and the Arduino extract GPS data using the GPS module that is interfaced with Arduino. When the data exceeds minimum stress limit then GSM module automatically sends message to family members with a Google Maps link.
